# Admission-Predictor
This project aims to predict admission outcomes using deep learning techniques. The model is trained on historical admission data, including factors such as test scores, GPA, and other relevant metrics. The deep learning model leverages neural networks to analyze patterns and make predictions based on the input data.

**Key Features:**
Deep Learning Model: Utilizes a neural network architecture to learn from the input data and make accurate predictions.
Data Preprocessing: Includes data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering to prepare the input data for the deep learning model.
Model Evaluation: Provides detailed evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess the performance of the admission predictor.

**Dependencies:**
* Python 3.x
* TensorFlow
* Keras
* NumPy
* Pandas
